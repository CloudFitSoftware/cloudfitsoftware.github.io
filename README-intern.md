### Introduction  ###
This project is for People Ops. This project is meant to convert the benefits.pdf file into an html document.
Not all of the content on the PDF was moved over to the HTML page. The stakeholder wanted some content added or removed.

**Function**
The purpose of this website is to give a list of benefits to prospective employees.

### Introduction ###

**Function**
The introduction has a title of "CloudFit strives to provide One-Size-Fits-One benefits tailored to you!" The title is too long, and it takes up 3 lines.
The paragraph and title are vertically centered relative to the image.
The nav bar in the website does not perfectly rediect you to different sections. I tried to work around this, but I could not get the nav bar to perfectly taget the section based on the target's location within the html. Every subsection (the bullet point list with an image, there are 9 if you include the introduction) are separated with the section tag in html.

### Health Benefits ###

**Function**
The Health, Dental, Financial, and Life benefits sections all have smaller text with subheaders. The Wellness program, time off, perks, and extra options sections have larger text with no subheaders.
The health section is the only main section that has an image that is vertically centered with the text. None of the other sections are centered like that.

### Dental ###

**Function**
This section covers both the dental and vision benefits with different insurance plans. The stock photo might need to change. The subheaders may need to be rearranged. 

### Financial Wellness ###

**Function**
This section covers 401k plans, discounts, and savings accounts. The subheadings appear too large for this section. Finding a good stock image for financial wellness benefits was hard, but we found one.

### Life and Disability ###

**Function**
This section covers short term and long term disabilities as well as Basic and Voluntary life insurance. The image is poorly centered relative to the text. The text is also a little long. The headers have consistent size and spacing.

### Wellness Program ###

**Function**
This section covers health events like the annual health fair and the fitness challenge. The text is not centered with the image, but it might work since it is just bullet points without subheadings.

### Leave and Time Off ###

**Function**
This section covers paid time off, parental leave, and paid holidays. Just like with the wellness program, the text is not centered, but it still looks okay.

### Perks, Rewards, and Recognition ###

**Function**
This section covers AwardCo and certification reimbursements. The bullet points are full sentences here (at the stakeholder's request). The bullet points are longer than the image, so the image needs to be vertically centered.

### Extra Options ###

**Function**
This section covers Pet Insurance, EAP, and Legal Insurance. There are only 3 bullet points in this section. The text might not need to be vertically centered since there are only 3 buller points here.
